# Cheerio: react-native app for creating cheerful sentences randomly

This is a test react-native app intended to create random sentences that can be
read every time one needs them.

I created this as a simple, personal project just to test a few things, both logic and design, but if this evolves properly I might upload it to google play. Also, this is intended for being an android app

## Planning

### Todo logic
* the app shows a random cheerful sentence from an internal list. You can click to "next sentence"
* the app shows a famous interesting quote from an internal list. you can click to "next sentence"
* the app let you input your own list that helps you remember it in the future
* you can program the app to remind you every X time about a sentences
* the system uses a randomly cheerful generated sentences
* check if there is some external service that gives quotes.
* maybe make a test to remember the list?
* maybe split both lists?

### Todo design
* create an interesting interface. Likely using gradients, but maybe we can make the gradient animated
* add some custom elements like icons or even drawings. Draw some characters for each type of sentence
  * clever-like guy or girl for the quotes
  * smiling guy or girl for the cheerful quotes
  * check another type for custom list


### Note:
* avoid using react-native@0.56.0 if you are developing in windows, because as for today looks like it is not working
